# Your first official PyCharm Assignment!

## Problem Description
For this assignment, write a program that prompts the user for two different pieces of information. Then, print a response that uses both in one sentence/phrase. Choose any topic(s) you wish.


### Example output
* with sample user responses in ():
```
What is your favorite treat? (chocolate)
What did you have for lunch? (salad)
chocolate covered salad might be tasty!
```
A note on capitalization: The case (upper, lower) of the word you enter via the keyboard will be the same when it is entered into the printed statement. You have two choices:
* Disregard captialization for now. (We'll deal with this more thoroughly soon.)
* Use the .upper() method to capitalize it on demand. Use `<variable_name>.upper()` in the f-string in place of `variable_name`. See Megan if you want help with this.


### Submitting your assignment
* First, test your program but running it a few times. Does it work correctly? Check the formatting - are spaces and punctuation coming out in the cirrect places?
* When you are ready, commit and push to GitHub.
* Check the repo web page to be sure your changes are there.
* Submit "done" on Canvas.
